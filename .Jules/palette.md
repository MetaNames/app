**Learning:** Async buttons that handle errors often fail to reset their error state on subsequent attempts. This leads to a confusing UX where a successful retry still displays the error icon, making the user believe the action failed again.
**Action:** Always ensure that error flags (e.g., `hasError`) are reset at the _start_ of the async operation, not just set in the `catch` block.
